# Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) Task Using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

This project was conducted during the _Ibn Sina Neurotech Summer School_, where we collected and analyzed SSVEP data using the Unicorn EEG headset. Subjects focused on one of four squares on a screen, each flickering at a different frequency. When observing such flickering, the human brain generates brainwaves with frequencies similar to the observedâ€” fascinating right?!

We applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to classify the frequencies based on the EEG signals. The aim was to enhance control applications like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Data and analysis methods used in this project are available in the repository.
